# Communicate_datafindings
As part of Udacity Nanodegree project

### DATASET 

This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, an exploratory data analysis on a dataset was conducted. There is the use Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis was structured by going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships. There were questions and answers to the choosen datasets.

In the second part, the main findings from your exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. To the end, 
a slide deck is created with polished explanatory visualisations to communicate the results.This part of the project should make heavy use of the first part of the project. 

This document explores a dataset containing the trip data of the ford gobike approximately 183,412 with 16 features (duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude ,end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip). Most variables are 9 numerical, and others are 2 datetime, 4 object type and 1 is boolean type.


### SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS

Trip duration seems to be dependent upon the age group ranging from 20 to 40 years. Similar trends were found comparing the genders and user types upon the duration of the trip.
